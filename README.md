# Algorithms2_Miniproject
This repository contains video explanations of two self-balancing binary search trees:

- BB[α]-Trees
- Scapegoat Trees

The videos explain the main ideas, operations, and balancing mechanisms using clear examples.

# 📌 BB[α]-Trees — Video Explanation

🔗 Link: https://www.loom.com/share/9270438706534f5e85da35d08fe5da2d

Summary:
This video explains what a BB[α]-tree is, the bounded-balance condition, and the role of the parameter α.
It demonstrates insertion and deletion, shows when the balance condition is violated, and explains how single and double rotations are used to restore balance.

# 📌 Scapegoat Trees — Video Explanation

🔗 Link: https://www.loom.com/share/ac27a9f89de84b42bb9b9c1f5ecc06eb

Summary:
This video introduces Scapegoat Trees and focuses on how they maintain balance using subtree sizes.
It covers search, insertion, and deletion, explains when a full rebuild is required, and discusses worst-case and amortized time complexity.

# 📂 Visualizations and GIFs

🔗 Repository: https://github.com/korrzh/Algorithms2_Miniproject.git

This repository contains GIF visualizations for each demonstrated tree.
The GIFs show step-by-step operations such as search, insertion, deletion, and rebalancing, making the behavior of each tree easier to understand.

# 🎯 Goal

The goal of these videos is to provide an intuitive and visual explanation of BB[α]-Trees and Scapegoat Trees, making their balancing strategies easier to understand.
